I Believe in You

Lonely, the path you have chosen
A restless road, no turning back
One day you will find your light again
Don't you know?
Don't let go, be strong

Follow your heart
Let your love lead through the darkness
Back to a place you once knew
I believe, I believe, I believe in you
Follow your dreams
Be yourself an angel of kindness
There's nothing that you cannot do
I believe, I believe, I believe in you
